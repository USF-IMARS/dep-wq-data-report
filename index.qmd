This collection of reports summarizes data provided by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection via [SEACAR](https://data.florida-seacar.org/).

The recommended quality control cleaning steps are applied and explained.

Reports are generated

* for each Water Quality (WQ) parameter
* showing rows provided by each data provider
* recommended quality control filtering across all sites
* details on the data files provided

The cleaned version of this data is fed into the [FL DEP WQ Dashboard](https://github.com/USF-IMARS/fl-coral-reef-fcr-water-quality-dashboard) for site-by-site exploration.

Source code for this website (and associated analysis) can be found at [github/USF-IMaRS/dep-wq-data-report](https://github.com/USF-IMARS/dep-wq-data-report).
